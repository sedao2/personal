#Question 2 Create an R Markdown document and do the following (include the R code in all of your answers)

#a)show the step-by-step how to solve the following system of equations in R (Use R chunks to run each part). 

2x + 5y = 33

x + 3y = 19

```{r}
a <- matrix(c(2, 1, 5, 3), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
b <- rbind(33, 19)
solve(a, b)
```

#b) create a vector that goes from 1 to 100 and calculates the average of it WITHOUT using the R function “mean”

```{r}
x<- 1:100
sum(x)/100
```

#c) install the package “dplyr”
```{r}
install.packages("dplyr", repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org')
```
# Question 3 create a data frame of two rows with A, B, C, and D in row 1 and D, E, F, and G in row 2

```{r}
column1<-c("A","D")
column2<-c("B","E")
column3<-c("C","F")
column4<-c("D","G")
df<- data.frame(column1,column2,column3,column4)
df
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
